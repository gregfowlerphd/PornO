# PornO
A repository for an ontology-in-progress of the adult film industry. The ontology will use Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as a top-level architecture and the Common Core Ontologies (CCO) as a mid-level architecture. Its scope will include professional production companies (such as Vixen Media Group and Bang Bros Studios), content creator platforms (such as OnlyFans and ManyVids), tube sites (such as Pornhub and Eporner), and related entities.

Such an ontology might be of use to a variety of stakeholders. The most obvious are adult companies and other players within the industry, who might employ it in numerous ways, including to support industry activity (much as the ontologies of the Industrial Ontologies Foundry are used in manufacturing) and in enforcement of industry protocols (such as those involving STD testing). Perhaps more importantly, it might also be of use to industry regulators and to government agents tasked with enforcing laws related to the industry, such as those concerned with unauthorized reproduction of copyrighted material or with the sharing of illegal content (including child pornography). Finally, academics who study the industry might find such an ontology to be a valuable tool in conducting their research.

The ontology will be designed with such stakeholder uses in mind, and stakeholders are encouraged to reach out (glfowler@gmail.com) to discuss the ontology, suggest further uses, provide advice, etc.
